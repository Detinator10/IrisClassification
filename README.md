# IrisClassification

This is a small machine learning project where I used a Support Vector Machine (among other models) to predict the species of Iris flowers based on measurable physical characteristics. As part of my code, I tried out several machine learning models and the SVM performed the best out of all of the models so I used that for my final analysis.
